# HabitTracker
Project 9 for Android Basics by Google Nanodegree.

Goal of the project:

design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user
to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI
components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing
how to design and implement a simple database.


Skills to learn from this project:

* Creating a SQLite table in your app
* Populating that table with new entries
* Modifying the entries
* Displaying the contents of the table to users.
